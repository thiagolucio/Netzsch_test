### Documentation (reusable components):
- I create simple documentation regarding reusable components that can be seen here through the [Wikki](WIKKI.md) file within the project root.
  
### Comments about:
- I tried to work with the latest version of NextJS as indicated in the official React documentation [ReactJS Start New Project](https://react.dev/learn/start-a-new-react-project)

  
- I decided to create my own backend (API) based on the solution pointed out in the document sent and thus not depend on any external solution or connection.
- This project was not created to run in production and was made for technical evaluation only (a POC).
- Both Storybook and Jest do not cover the entire project, just a few examples were created to demonstrate knowledge in implementing and configuring.
- The graph from **"Rechart"** presented is simple, just to demonstrate knowledge, and is not a reusable component, which in some cases would be normal to be done in a real project.

### Tecnologias utilizadas:
- ReactJS through Next with TypeScript.
- TailwindCSS
- Storybook for functionality testing and technical showcase
- Jest for testing.
- Lottie for animations.

### Concerns:
- I did the best I could with the time I had for it. It took 3 days to do it in the middle of one of the most celebrated holidays in Brazil (Carnival) and with family at home visiting me. I don't know if this matters for your assessment, but it certainly had a huge impact on my time available to carry out this test.
